## Business Problem Statement

Swire Coca-Cola faces challenges with its current reactive maintenance process, which leads to extended machine downtimes, high operational costs, and reduced productivity. The company struggles to predict machine failures and manage maintenance schedules and inventory efficiently. This unpredictability affects their ability to meet customer demand and strains financial resources.

To address this, Swire Coca-Cola requires a predictive maintenance solution that forecasts potential machine breakdowns, enabling proactive maintenance and better inventory management. By analyzing historical data from the Internal Warehouse Controller (IWC) system, our goal is to understand the causes of machine failures, predict future downtimes, and ensure the necessary parts are available in advance.

The solution will aim to reduce unplanned downtimes, improve machine reliability, and optimize production capacity, thereby minimizing financial losses.

## Benefit of Solution

The predictive maintenance model will provide Swire Coca-Cola with the following benefits:
- **Forecast potential machine breakdowns** and plan maintenance in advance, reducing unplanned downtimes.
- **Optimize inventory management** by predicting required parts based on maintenance needs.
- **Quantify opportunity costs** of downtime, improving financial performance and increasing production capacity.
- **Balance machine usage** and longevity to meet production targets without overburdening equipment.

## Analytical Approach

Our approach includes the following steps:
1. **Data Exploration and Feature Engineering**: Analyze IWC data, downtime records, and maintenance logs to identify failure patterns.
2. **Model Development**: Build a predictive model that uses historical breakdowns and maintenance data to anticipate future downtimes.
3. **Simulation and Validation**: Validate the model using simulations and feedback from the production team to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness.
4. **Predictive Maintenance Pipeline**: Develop a system that flags potential downtimes, recommends maintenance, and optimizes spare parts inventory.

## Success Metrics

The success of this project will be measured by the following KPIs:
- **Reduction in unplanned downtimes** by a measurable percentage.
- **Improved overall equipment effectiveness (OEE)**.
- **Increased production output**, aiming to close the gap in meeting production targets.
- **Cost savings** from reduced downtime and better inventory management.

## Scope

The deliverables for this project include:
- A **detailed report** outlining the predictive maintenance model, insights into downtime causes, and maintenance schedule recommendations.
- A **dashboard** for production and supply chain teams to monitor machine health and predict potential failures.
- Python or R **code for the predictive model**, integrated with Swire Coca-Cola's systems.
- **Comprehensive documentation** covering model development, feature selection, and future improvements.

## Project Details

The project is executed by the MSBA Capstone team at the University of Utah and is scheduled for completion by December 12, 2024. The following milestones are planned:

1. **Business Problem Statement Delivery**: September 15, 2024
2. **Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis**: October 2, 2024
3. **Model Development and Validation**: October 30, 2024
4. **Final Presentation and Handover**: November 20, 2024
